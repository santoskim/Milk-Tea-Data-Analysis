# Milk-Tea-Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores subjects' experience of purchasing milk tea drinks across the San Gabriel Valley. Subjects provide data by filling out a spreadsheat that contains information such as shop name, city, distance, reviewer name, price, drink name, boba, rating, ranking, and comments. The collected data enables us to investigate relationships between variables and utilize statistical methods.

We utilized RStudio and its libraries to perform predictive modeling and statistical analyses to conceptualize and share insights on the performance of each city and subjects' experience.
